Worksheet:
1a) It would call the subroutine to open the file for writing.
b) If menu 1 is chosen, it is opened in write mode, if menu 2 is, its opened in append mode.
c) testsResultsfile, studentName, studentMark
d) studentName, studentMark
e) 
   saveToFile("append")
   else if option...


2a) It sets a buffer, and then lets you change the name of the file. It opens the file for binary file writing. After,
   it reads the picture file at 50000 bytes at a time. And while the file hasn't finished writing, it prints dots.

b) 477KB / 50000 bytes = (477 x 1080)/50000 = 10 times

c) It outputs dots, and once the file has finished writing, it will stop printing the dots, and it will print a space.


Using exception handling statements (try, except), you can intercept and handle exceptions so that your program does not 
crash - and it will do what the programmer specifies:

try:
	a = int(input("Enter a number"))
except:
	print("Enter a number")
