Programming plan:
> The plan is to make an interactive, compact, and helpfull website (or application if all fails) to put across content regarding:
  different programing languages - understandable descriptions, common applications, project ideas, unique libraries, compatability etc.

> I'm going to try and graph different "pipelines", common routes in the industry, links to good tutorials, and I'll try to explain the basics
  and advanced information.

Specifics;
(phase one):
> Setting up flask and other components (the skeleton);
	> Using bootstrap, css and java script to make a template,
	> Attempting to make a scrollable path {*1} (linear at first),
	> Making the path divergent.
% Can't spend too long on this stage - I can always finish the writting
  of content in my spare time.

(phase two):
> Implementation of sql;
	> Setting things up for future use.

(phase three):
> Implementation of an account system;
	> User accounts will be stored in a database.
	> Try to encrypt data while being requested and posted.

(phase four):
> Implementation of algorithms;
	> To search through information/web-pages,
	> Allowing the user to browse through user profiles.

(phase five):
> Filling in more information - doing research and analysis.

(phase six):
> Adding in forums, blogs and more;
	> Users will have the ability to curate their own content, and 
	  will be able to fix problems with pre-existing tutorials etc.

(phase seven):
> Making sure everything is working, and also backed up,
> Smoothing things out, should be grinding the course work,
> Testing (but surface level tbh).

(phase eight):
> Adding a global chat where people can discuss things, and just have
  casual talks.

(phase nine?):
> Just coursework atp kid...
 

(phase four):
> Implementing a forum/blog like system, where people can exchange 
  information about programming, can give tips, help others with 
  errors, make tutorials, make already exisiting tutorials clearer etc.

Libraries and other stuff:
$ Python:
> flask
$ Javascript:
> jQuery, bootstrap, vin.js, mermaid, D3, graphviz {*1}
