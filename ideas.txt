Lets not be oblivious now, I'm in a drought for ideas.

Ideas:
A browser that renders html, css, and json content.
Will implement a free dns and website hosting system using github.

A real time chat, using flask or django, which includes a chat search.
The chat search will use algorithms and data query techniques.

A 3d game (or investigation into 3d rendering).
This is obviously more challenging, since I will need to learn c++ and 
OpenGl(Already learnt to render a window).

An overcomplicated

A web scraping and data manipulation project - could be on the job 
market, or on social media trends? I would find some sort of theory or 
idea that can be linked in to this (in order to get motivation).
